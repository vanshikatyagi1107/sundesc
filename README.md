# sundesc - A Simple Weather Website

Sundesc is a simple and clean weather website that shows the current weather for any city you search. What makes it a little special is that the look of the app changes based on the weather — sunny, rainy, cloudy, or snowy, the background and colors shift to match the mood. It’s also fully responsive, so it works smoothly on both phones and desktops.

## Features
- Search weather by city name or use the current location.
- Display temperature, humidity, wind speed, visibility, and pressure.
- Real-time clock and day display.
- Dynamic theming based on weather conditions.
- Multiple views (Hour, Day, Week) with automatic highlighting of the current day.
- Modal interface for city input.
- Responsive UI updates with smooth transitions.

## How it Works
The app fetches data from a weather API (OpenWeatherMap) when you enter a city name. It then updates the weather info and adjusts the look and feel of the page depending on the conditions (like a gray background if it’s cloudy, etc.).
