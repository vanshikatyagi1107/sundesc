# sundesc - A Simple Weather Website

Sundesc is a simple and clean weather website that shows the current weather for any city you search. What makes it a little special is that the look of the app changes based on the weather — sunny, rainy, cloudy, or snowy, the background and colors shift to match the mood. It’s also fully responsive, so it works smoothly on both phones and desktops.

## Features
- Live weather for any city using real-time data
- The theme changes based on weather (sunny, cloudy, rain, etc.)
- Clean and minimal design
- Fully responsive – works well on both desktop and mobile

## How it Works
The app fetches data from a weather API (OpenWeatherMap) when you enter a city name. It then updates the weather info and adjusts the look and feel of the page depending on the conditions (like a gray background if it’s cloudy, etc.).
